Objective:
The object of the game is to make matches of dice as either three of a kind or a straight,
matching dice values and colours.

Difficulty:
There are three levels of difficult: easy, medium, hard.
The difficulties add more dice colours, time, and required score to win.

Controls:
The player can click any two dice to swap their places as long as they're adjacent, but not diagonal.

Scoring:
Three of a Kind, vertically or horizontally, is worth 100 points.
A Straight (1-5 or 2-6) is worth 250 points.
 - Straights are made left to right, or top down, but not in reverse.
